Hello! I'm Renato Fialho ðŸ‘‹ , a Software Engineer currently based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

I have experience building concurrent and resilient applications using Java, Kotlin, Spring, J2EE, PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka, AWS (ECS, EKS, S3, SQS, SNS) and other technologies.

My recent experience is mainly in building payments applications in fintech companies such as [Klarna](http://www.klarna.com), [Toro Investimentos](https://www.toroinvestimentos.com.br/) and [Hotmart](https://www.hotmart.com.br/).

While not working/coding, you will probably find me reading topics in [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/) and/or finding for good topics at [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

I'm interested to know and learn how we can solve real world problems using technologies/frameworks/languages. I love to know more about enterpreunership, finance , sports and music, and probably those are the subjects you will read on this blog, mixed or not.

Wanna talk about something, hire me or are looking for a consultant? [Send me an email](/contact)!
