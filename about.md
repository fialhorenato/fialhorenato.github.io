Hi!

I'm Renato Fialho, and I'm a bachelor in Computer Science currently helping as a Research Assistant at [LBS](http://www.lbs.dcc.ufmg.br/), where i have the chance to work with bigdata, data visualization and standardization of data of proteins and ligands, mainly from [PDB](http://www.pdb.com).

I'm also looking for a CS Masters in Data Visualization.

I also worked at [Vale](http://www.vale.com.br) as an IT Business Partner intern and [INDG](http://www.indg.com.br) as an IT Infrastructure intern.
