I'm Renato Fialho, a Full Stack Developer based in Belo Horizonte - MG , Brazil.

I used to work as a web software developer at [Toro Investimentos](http://www.tororadar.com.br){:target="_blank"} where I had the chance to develop systems using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/){:target="_blank"} and many other technologies.

While not working/coding, you will probably find me reading topics in [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/) and/or finding for good topics at [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

I'm interested to know and learn about new technologies/frameworks/languages. I usually loves to know more about enterpreunership, finance , sports and music. And probably those are the subjects you will read on this blog, mixed or not.

I used to be a Research Assistant at [LBS](http://www.lbs.dcc.ufmg.br/) too, where I had the chance to work with data visualization using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/){:target="_blank"} and [d3.js](https://d3js.org/){:target="_blank"}, developing beautiful, useful and concise [data visualization](/projects/LSC) and standardization of data protein and ligands, mainly from PDB.

I also worked at [Vale](http://www.vale.com){:target="_blank"} as an IT Business Partner Intern and at [INDG](http://www.indg.com.br){:target="_blank"} and [UNA](http://una.br){:target="_blank"} as an IT Infrastructure Intern. 

My current toolset is â€“ Python , Flask , Pytest , Ruby , Rails , CakePHP , MySQL , Mongo.db , Node , Mocha , and Vagrant.
