I'm Renato Fialho, a Full Stack Developer based in Stockholm , Sweden.

Currently, i work as a Senior Software Engineer for [Klarna](http://www.klarna.com) where i develop mainly backend services using Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka and other distributed systems technologies.

While not working/coding, you will probably find me reading topics in [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/) and/or finding for good topics at [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

I'm interested to know and learn about new technologies/frameworks/languages. I usually loves to know more about enterpreunership, finance , sports and music. And probably those are the subjects you will read on this blog, mixed or not.

I helped as a Research Assistant at [LBS](http://www.lbs.dcc.ufmg.br/) in [UFMG](http://www.ufmg.br) too, where I had the chance to work creating beautiful, useful, concise and reliable [data visualizations](/projects/LSC) using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [d3.js](https://d3js.org/).

I'm currently working with the following languages/tools, but not only â€“ Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, Docker, Flutter, Gradle, Maven, Python, Ruby on Rails, Elasticsearch, AWS, PostgreSQL.
