Many of us have experienced both sides of the interview table when it comes to recruiting.In this post i'll talk about one of the most controversial step in the hiring process : **the technical test**, and why senior developers are not willing to do your tests.

### What do you mean, technical test?

First of all, let's give some examples of technical tests:

- Coding test to be completed at home which gets you to the next round. (or NOT)

- Coding exercise online at home doing pair programming on the interview

- Pair programming in the company premises.

- Whiteboard exercises in the interview room.

### You are not Google, or Facebook, neither them do what you do

Copying the "Google" or "Facebook" style of interviews won't turn your company into Google or Facebook. 

Even Google isn't really the image what you have of Google. Every company must be different, and the best way to sell that company and to find, attract, and hire the best people, is to understand the company, the team, the environment and the role.

 It also means that if the candidate has been judged against criteria that really are important to getting the job done, there’s a good chance that when the candidate is offered and takes the job, they’re the right person for that role.

 ### Value the effort of the candidate, and the power of feedback

 Most of the companies that requires the - **Coding test to be completed at home which gets you to the next round. (or NOT)** - don't provide any feedback, and some of them provide a helpless vague feedback.

 Those type of tests demands a high time cost and low value gained for the candidate, and the **MINIMUM** that you should provide, since it's a technical test, is a technical feedback on what that candidate can improve.

 If your companys is doing this, you're paving the road that good developers won't wanna work for you.

 ### Why the best developers don’t do technical tests

 The problem is that organizations don’t always look at the costs to the candidate. 
 
 Maybe because they see there are a lot of candidates out there and they believe they can play a numbers game—for every candidate who doesn’t have the time or inclination to complete the tech task, there are several who are willing to. 
 
 But what organizations may not not realize is the true cost to themselves. Candidates are not all created equal. What if the ones that don’t have time / can’t be bothered to take the tests are the best candidates? How likely is this?

 **Pretty likely.**

 Why?

- The most experienced developers have families, life outside of work, or have simply been through enough tech tests in their lives that they just don’t want to do another made-up test for a company they’ve never heard of.

- The developers who are most active in the open source community are being snatched up by companies like AirBnb, Uber, Facebook, Google  , who are looking at developers’ real-life code in GitHub and judging them based on real examples of actual working projects. They can offer them a job without forcing them to spend their free time on a code that will never be used.

- The technologists who can explain tech concepts to other developers at conferences, or via their blogs, are being offered jobs at companies who see value in being the type of company that adds to the overall technical community.

That’s just a few examples. However, it gives you an idea of why some organizations might be missing out on technical talent, simply by having a process that’s the most convenient for them without considering the opportunity cost of losing good candidates.

### Forget “superstar” developers, most developers aren’t doing your test

As an employer, it’s easy to pick a test that suits your timescale best.

 Often the temptation (and seemingly logical thing to do) is set the tech test right after the CV screening, i.e. before the candidate speaks to a human in the company. This keeps the cost to the company very low, because you don’t need to invest any time in phone screens or face to face interviews with a candidate who doesn’t know the difference between an if statement and a for loop. 
 
 So you ping out your standard technical test, and only those developers who can really code will make it onto your premises. Right?

But lets think about the candidate again. For them it’s a numbers game too. 

They’ll probably be applying for a number of jobs at the same time. They’ve sent a CV to them all, and hopefully a customized cover letter. But now they have to complete a different technical test for every one of them. 

In my experience from both sides of the process, a technical test can take somewhere between 1 and 12 hours, the average time people spend on them is probably round about 4 hours. 

If a candidate is going to spend **4** hours on each test to do it properly (or at least, well enough to not be ashamed of it), they’re going to select the companies they most want to work for, and do those tests first. They might get around to the other tests, they might give them 30 minutes or so, or they might not bother.

Companies should try to make all candidates feel excited about the company, to want to work there, as even if they didn’t get the job they would tell all their friends what a great place it was. Do not underestimate the value of word of mouth , the tech community is a small world.
