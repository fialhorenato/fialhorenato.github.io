If you are a "newbie", you probably read a lot of times people saying to you: ```"If you want to learn, you have to develop, go to Github and contribute"```

Then you think: ```"Ok, but if i'm a newbie and don't have experience, how can i help?"```

With these tips, you will find a way to help the community.

#### Open Source will help you!

Contribute with the Open Source will change your life, you will improve your development, git and github skills, and people will give you tips in how to work
in a teamwork environment and improve your workflow.

#### So, if you're ready, let's introduce you into how to contribute!

First of all, you must go to [Github](http://www.github.com) and click on [Explore](https://github.com/explore). Some categories will show up to you, and if you get interested, you can click on them and start.

Supposing that you will contribute to javascript frameworks, when you access this category, it will show up a lot of projects. Choose one that will fit your needs, don't pick the projects based on reputation or a lot of contributors. Help to improve/grown yourself and the project in a useful way. 

Assuming that you picked [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) (because it was the first one to shown up), so you can fork the project, download in your PC and start to test and look up for bugs.

First of all that is:

**Search** the projects that opened your eyes and bring up your **Interest**, then **Fork** into your computer.


#### Documentation Bugs

First thing to do before look for bugs is **READ THE DOCUMENTATION**. If during this reading you find something wrong, you can start to contribute.

You can fix errors in writing, logic or examples of this documentation. Fix it and send a pull request if you know the language, if you not, open an Issue for someone to fix it.

Easy, huh?

#### Code Bugs

If you have experience on the language of the project you forked, so it's time to run some tests or look for bugs. If you do not have experience, you can open an issue to someone fix.

``` Alert : Do not send a poor description of the problem, show the bug and get most information possible to send the issue. ```

#### Open Issues

If you already know the project well, you can look the opened issues and try to fix them, is the same procedure for code bugs, fixes and pull requests. The opened issues are located in the right side of the project interface of github.

#### Improve suggestions

If you use this project and think that they must add something, something useful to the project, you can open an ```Issue```. The developers will analyze and think
if it's viable to add this to the project.

#### Translation

A lot of projects need translation to another languages, supposing that you speak german, or mandarin, or portuguese, go help with it! You can translate the documentation and interfaces.

``` Tip : It's an awesome way to improve and check your language perfomance! ```

#### Then

Let's go make a difference on the open source community!
