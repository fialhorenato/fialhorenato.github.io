## CSVisualization

This is a data visualization of CSV files using python and d3.js.

The pre-processing is made using python that generates .json files to d3.js consumes.

It's using pandas to get the CSV files, so you will need to run `sudo pip install pandas` if you use `pip` or `sudo conda install pandas` if you use `conda`

To run the python script uses `python generator.py file.csv`

It will generate a graph.json file, that you can visualize on index.html
